  title: Amazon Glacier API Delete  Vault  Access  Policy
  version: 1.0.0
  description: "DescriptionThis operation deletes the access policy associated with
    the specified vault. The\n\t\t\toperation is eventually consistent&#8212;that
    is, it might take some time for Amazon Glacier to\n\t\t\tcompletely remove the
    access policy, and you might still see the effect of the policy\n\t\t\tfor a short
    time after you send the delete request. This operation is idempotent. You can
    invoke delete multiple times, even if there is\n\t\t\tno policy associated with
    the vault. For more information about vault access policies,\n\t\t\tsee Amazon
    Glacier Access Control with Vault Access Policies.RequestsTo delete the current
    vault access policy, send an HTTP DELETE request to\n\t\t\tthe URI of the vault's
    access-policy subresource."

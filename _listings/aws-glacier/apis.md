description: Amazon Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost cloud storage
  service for data archiving and long-term backup. Customers can reliably store large
  or small amounts of data for as little as $0.004 per gigabyte per month, a significant
  savings compared to on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying
  retrieval needs, Amazon Glacier provides three options for access to archives, from
  a few minutes to several hours.

    time after you send the delete request. This operation is idempotent. You can
